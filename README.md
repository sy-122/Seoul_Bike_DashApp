# Visualisation design

Explaination of visualization : [Visualization Design.pdf](Visualization Design.pdf)

# Dash app

The app is for two different group of users (explained in the 'Visualisation design').
It is made so it's not too complicated for the wide audience to use, but to be engaging 

Although it was planed to make multiple pages, to focus more on graph/visualization and
overall interaction of the webpage, it is currently a single webpage. 
Hence, although there is a navigation bar with two different pages those pages are
currently not active but will be in the future. 

The dash app has two tabs that divide the visualizations as the first one uses time related variables and the 
second tab uses other variables, which are related to the weather. There are different interactive functions
in the app that allows users to take more control of the dash app.

*It can take time for the visualization to load so please be patient.*
